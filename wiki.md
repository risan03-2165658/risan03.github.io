# Best Studio Ghibli Movies

Studio Ghibli is a Japanese animation studio directed by Miyazaki Hayao, in Tokyo since 1985. Studio Ghibli movies are renowned for their unique and visually enchanting animation aesthetic. Their commitment to *intricate details, hand-drawn aesthetics*, *beautiful music* and *meticulous craftsmanship* results in a visually rich and immersive cinematic experience. In this wiki, I will be introducing **three** best movies I recommend that you check out!

## One: Princess Mononoke

### Plot: In the 14th century, harmony among humans, animals, and gods unravels. Ashitaka, infected by an animal attack, seeks a cure from the deer-like god Shishigami. Witnessing humans devastating the earth, he encounters the wrath of wolf god Moro and Princess Mononoke. His peace efforts only breed conflict.

What renders Princess Mononoke a timeless masterpiece is that although Miyazaki is undeniably disheartened by humanity's actions, he discovers that his cynicism transforms into a genuine faith in the enduring strength of nature and the human spirit.

## Two: Castle in the Sky

### Plot: Young orphan Sheeta is abducted by Col. Muska and their aircraft is attacked by air pirates led by the formidable Dola. She escapes mid-air through a magical crystal and joins forces with fellow orphan Pazu. Together, they seek the legendary floating city of Laputa, pursued by both Muska and the treasure-hungry pirates.

This is personally my favorite piece. It's carming animation strikes a balance between its playful moments and a thrilling sense of adventure, making it a delightful experience overall.

## Three: Spirited Away

### Plot: 10-year-old Chihiro (Rumi Hiiragi) and her parents (Takashi Nait√¥, Yasuko Sawaguchi) discover what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. When her parents are transformed into giant pigs, Chihiro encounters the enigmatic Haku (Miyu Irino), who reveals that the park is a retreat for supernatural beings seeking respite from the human world. To rescue her family, Chihiro must work at the park and navigate its mystical challenges.

This movie is also amazing. It's a captivating world full of spirits and gods, but what makes it unique is that it doesn't sort characters into simple good and bad categories like many children's movies do. Instead, each character has their own reasons for what they do, and they see their actions as well-intentioned in their own way.
